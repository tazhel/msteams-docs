# Request device permissions for your Microsoft Teams tab

You might want to enrich your tab with features that require access to native device functionality like:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Camera
> * Microphone
> * Location
> * Notifications

> [!NOTE]
> To integrate camera and image capabilities within your Microsoft Teams mobile app, see [Camera and image capabilities in Teams.](../../concepts/device-capabilities/mobile-camera-image-permissions.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * At present, Teams mobile client only supports access to `camera`, `gallery`, `mic`, and `location` through native device capabilities and is available on all app constructs including tabs. </br>
> * Support for `camera`, `gallery`, and `mic` is enabled through [**selectMedia API**](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/media?view=msteams-client-js-latest#selectMedia_MediaInputs___error__SdkError__attachments__Media_______void_&preserve-view=true). For single image capture you may use [**captureImage API**](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/microsoftteams?view=msteams-client-js-latest#captureimage--error--sdkerror--files--file-------void-&preserve-view=true).
> * Support for `location` is enabled through [**getLocation API**](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/location?view=msteams-client-js-latest#getLocation_LocationProps___error__SdkError__location__Location_____void_&preserve-view=true). It's recommended you use this API as [**geolocation API**](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#devicepermissions) is currently not fully supported on all desktop clients.

## Device permissions

Accessing a user’s device permissions allows you to build much richer experiences, for example:

* Record and share short videos
* Record short audio memos and save them for later
* Use user location information to display relevant information

While access to these features is standard in most modern web browsers, you need to let Teams know which features you’d like to use by updating your app manifest. This will allow you to ask for permissions, the same way you would in a browser, while your app is running on the Teams desktop client.

## Manage permissions

# [Desktop](#tab/desktop)

1. Open Teams.
1. In the upper right corner of the window, select your profile icon.
1. Select **Settings** -> **Permissions** from the drop-down menu.
1. Choose your desired settings.

# [Mobile](#tab/mobile)

1. Open Teams.
1. Go to **Settings** -> **App Permissions**.
1. Select the app you need to choose settings for.
1. Choose your desired settings.

## Properties

Update your app's `manifest.json` by adding `devicePermissions` and specifying which of the five properties you’d like to use in your application:

``` json
"devicePermissions": [
    "media",
    "geolocation",
    "notifications",
    "midi",
    "openExternal"
],
```
> [!Note]
>
> Media is also used for camera permissions on mobile.

Each property will allow you to prompt the user to ask for their consent:

| Property      | Description   |
| --- | --- |
| media         | permission to use the camera, microphone, speakers, and access media gallery |
| geolocation   | permission to return the user's location      |
| notifications | permission to send the user notifications      |
| midi          | permission to send and receive midi information from a digital musical instrument   |
| openExternal  | permission to open links in external applications  |

## Checking permissions from your tab

Once you’ve added `devicePermissions` to your app manifest, you can check permissions using the HTML5 “permissions” API without causing a prompt.

``` Javascript
// Different query options:
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'camera' });
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'microphone' });
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'geolocation' });
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'notifications' });
navigator.permissions.query({ name: 'midi', sysex: true });

// Example:
navigator.permissions.query({name:'geolocation'}).then(function(result) {
  if (result.state == 'granted') {
    // Access granted
  } else if (result.state == 'prompt') {
    // Access has not been granted
  }
});
```

## Prompting the user

To show a prompt to get consent to access device permissions you need to leverage the appropriate HTML5 or Teams API. 

For example, to prompt the user to access their location you need to call `getCurrentPosition`:

```Javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function (position) { /*... */ });
```

To use the camera on desktop or web, Teams will show a permission prompt when you call `getUserMedia`:

```Javascript
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true });
```

To capture the image on mobile, Teams mobile will ask for permission when you call `captureImage()`:

```Javascript
microsoftTeams.media.captureImage((error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, files: microsoftTeams.media.File[]) => {
  /* ... */
});
```

Notifications will prompt the user when you call `requestPermission`:

```Javascript
Notification.requestPermission(function(result) { /* ... */ });
```

To use camera or access photo gallery, Teams mobile will ask permission when you call `selectMedia()`:

```JavaScript
microsoftTeams.media.selectMedia({ maxMediaCount: 10, mediaType: microsoftTeams.media.MediaType.Image }, (error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, attachments: microsoftTeams.media.Media[]) => {
  /* ... */
});
```

To use mic, Teams mobile will ask permission when you call `selectMedia()`:

```JavaScript 
microsoftTeams.media.selectMedia({ maxMediaCount: 1, mediaType: microsoftTeams.media.MediaType.Audio }, (error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, attachments: microsoftTeams.media.Media[]) => {
  /* ... */
});
```

To prompt user to share location on map interface, Teams mobile will ask permission when you call `getLocation()`:

```JavaScript 
microsoftTeams.location.getLocation({ allowChooseLocation: true, showMap: true }, (error: microsoftTeams.SdkError, location: microsoftTeams.location.Location) => {
  /* ... */
});
```

## Permission behavior across login sessions

Native device permissions are stored for every login session. It means that if you log into another instance of Teams (ex: on another computer), your device permissions from your previous sessions will not be available. Instead, you will need to re-consent to device permissions for the new login session. It also means, if you log out of Teams (or switch tenants inside of Teams), your device permissions will be deleted for that previous login session. Please keep this in mind when developing native device permissions: the native capabilities you consent to are only for your _current_ login session.
